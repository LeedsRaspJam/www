> Raspberry Jams are independently organised community events for people to come together to learn about digital making with Raspberry Pi. Jam events come in all shapes and sizes: workshops for beginners, drop-in sessions to work on your own projects, show-and-tell, talks, and more. A Jam is a meeting of all kinds of people: some will be new to physical computing, and some will have plenty of experience that they are happy to share. Jams are welcoming events where youâ€™ll meet and learn from like-minded people in a friendly environment

Leeds Raspberry Jam is hosted on every Wednesday of the month at [Dixons Unity Academy](https://www.dixonsua.com/), everyone is welcome at the free event. If you would like to get tickets you can do so at our [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/the-foundation-for-digital-creativity-19981872804)
